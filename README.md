# Python
This is a compilation of Python projects I completed either for fun or via course work. 
Some scripts are for demonstration purposes only, as they will have empty hard coded folder paths or missing required support data etc.
These projects are GIS-centric and will most likely require arcpy to run.
The scripts become increasingly more complex, so PyProj1 will be very basic, and PyProj10 will be quite complex; for GUI related support .py files, I have named them accordingly to match their PrProjX schema.
